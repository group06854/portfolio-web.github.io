        <p id = "information">As a first-year student at Innopolis University, I came from Glazov, Udmurtia, after studying at the Physics and Mathematics Lyceum (FML), where I laid a solid foundation in mathematics and computer science. My lifelong love of strategy games has ignited my passion for programming and software development. Having mastered Python, C, C++, Java, HTML and CSS, I honed these skills through projects in FML, applying theory in practice and developing a deep understanding of software development. In addition to academic work, I have worked on personal projects, improving my programming, problem solving and creativity skills. At Innopolis, I strive to expand my technical knowledge, immerse myself in new technologies and contribute to cutting-edge projects, using my passion for technology and strategic mindset to influence computer science and more.</p>
